## Roadmap

As a Frictionless Data for Reproducible Research Fellow, my goal is to make my previous and future research more accessible (sharing the data and the code used to analyze it, generating DOIs to ensure they can be found, etc.). Besides, I will collaborate with open source projects to generate data packages that can be used as worked-out example datasets.
